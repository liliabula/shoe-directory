The best work I've ever seen. Will definitely be using the Kirby Allison service again. Thanks for the great work.",

They did a terrific job on the sole protectors, but let me tell you about the rebuild, these shoes are better than when they were brand new. I am happy that I found this shoe cobbler and I will be bringing him many more shoes that need rebuilding. Love the work that you do! Keep posting those videos, they are meaningful and make an impact!",
